This branch is for development of changes to the Windows project file
generator so that the generated projects can use pre-built
dependencies provided here:

    http://github.com/brainy/subversion-windeps

The intent is to eventually include those dependency builder scripts
into the Subversion project, and making the project file generator
flexible enough to support different dependency layouts.

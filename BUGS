If you've found a bug in Subversion, please report it to

   dev@subversion.tigris.org

If the bug is in the APR library, please report it to all of these
lists:

   dev@subversion.tigris.org
   dev@apr.apache.org

   (If the above two aren't getting results for some reason, Greg
   Stein suggests Ryan Bloom <rbb@apache.org>, "who could be
   considered the lead for APR", as a backup.)

If the bug is in Neon, please report it to

   neon@webdav.org

If the bug is in your rug, please give it a hug and keep it snug.

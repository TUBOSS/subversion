Subversion installs using the usual GNU procedure:

   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make check
   # make install

However, if you don't have Berkeley DB 3.2.9 installed on your system,
you'll need that first.  Get it from

   http://www.sleepycat.com

Note that 3.2.9 is not the latest release of Berkeley DB; Subversion
probably works just fine with 3.3.11 too, but that combination hasn't
been tested as thoroughly yet.  We recommend 3.2.9.

(Note: if you already have a higher version of Berkeley DB installed
and don't want to downgrade, you can unpack the Berkeley 3.2.9
distribution into a subdir named `db' in the top-level of the
Subversion source tree.  Then Subversion will ignore the system DB and
use the one it found in its own source tree.)

Now you can run the GNU install procedure given previously.  Please
mail dev@subversion.tigris.org if you have any problems.

If you are going to work on the code, you may prefer to run configure
like this:

   ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode --disable-shared

This will build statically linked binaries, which may save you some
headache when rebuilding later, as subversion won't try to link with
shared libraries left over from previous installs.

Subversion installs using the usual GNU procedure:

   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ make check
   # make install

However, this is a development release, and therefore not as
thoughtfully packaged as it might be.  So you'll need to do these
things first:

   1. Subversion depends on Berkeley DB 3.2.9.  Get it from
      http://www.sleepycat.com and install it on your system.  Note
      that 3.2.9 is not the latest release of Berkeley DB; Subversion
      probably works just fine with 3.3.11 too, but that combination
      hasn't been tested as thoroughly yet.  We recommend 3.2.9.

   2. Subversion depends the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library.
      Get it from xxx and unpack it into a subdirectory named "apr/"
      at the same level as this INSTALL file.  [todo: should we
      recommend cvs checkout or should we provide a tarball?  Tarball
      is the standard answer, so we can guarantee which version of APR
      people use, but it might be better for testers to stay at the
      bleeding edge too...]

   3. Subversion depends on Neon 0.15.3, an HTTP and WebDAV client
      library.  Get it from http://www.webdav.org/neon and unpack it
      into a subdirectory named "neon/" at the same level as this
      INSTALL file.

Now you can run the GNU install procedure given previously.  Please
mail dev@subversion.tigris.org if you have any problems.

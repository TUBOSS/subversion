If you're looking for a task to take on, please see the TASKS file.

This file merely lists immediate, short-term (next few days) stuff on
people's stacks.  It may make reference to phone conversations and
private emails, so a given item might not make much sense unless one
is familiar with its out-of-band context.  We keep this file under
version control mainly for convenience -- feel free to add your own
short-term tasks to it, if that's helpful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ben and Karl XML factorization todo:
   - generalize signal_expat_bailout

Ben todo:
   - crawler

Karl working copy todo:
   - make updates work as checkouts do (should only be a little bit
     left)
   - work on properties, or work with someone on props
   - fix working copy identification/allergy code
   - oh my goodness, what is *up* with that bug in free_file_baton?
   - reduce or remove svn_wc__write_adm_item() and v_write_adm_item(),
     because they're now redundant with the generalized XML output
     code.
   - to get commits working:
         - check XML outputter (get_to_elem)
         - find & fix that pesky alloc bug, arrgh, is it in APR pools??
         - have working crawler, that puts in commit tokens
         - make sure timestamp code works
         - find out about the prop_delta problem
         - finish svn_wc_commit_close()

Ben and Karl more later:
   - xml dtd, for both xml deltas and wc formats

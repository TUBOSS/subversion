If you're looking for a task to take on, please see the TASKS file.

This file merely lists immediate, short-term (next few days) stuff on
people's stacks.  It may make reference to phone conversations and
private emails, so a given item might not make much sense unless one
is familiar with its out-of-band context.  We keep this file under
version control mainly for convenience -- feel free to add your own
short-term tasks to it, if that's helpful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ben and Karl XML factorization todo:
   - generalize signal_expat_bailout

Ben todo:
   - crawler

Karl working copy todo:
   - make updates work as checkouts do (should only be a little bit
     left)
   - work on properties, or work with someone on props
   - probably decide that all entries in a versions file will always
     be listed explicitly (they'd have to be for checksums to be kept
     anyway), and change the documentation about this everywhere.
     Should result in no code changes, as none of the code folded
     redundant version information anyway.
   - fix working copy identification/allergy code
   - an xml-writing editor (should be 2 to 3 hours tops)
   - oh my goodness, what is *up* with that bug in free_file_baton?
   - timestamps
   - checksums?

Karl/all todo:
   - ancestry args to replace_root go away?  Think about this.

Ben and Karl more later:
   - xml dtd, for both xml deltas and wc formats

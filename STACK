If you're looking for a task to take on, please see the TASKS file.

This file merely lists immediate, short-term (next few days) stuff on
people's stacks.  It may make reference to phone conversations and
private emails, so a given item might not make much sense unless one
is familiar with its out-of-band context.  We keep this file under
version control mainly for convenience -- feel free to add your own
short-term tasks to it, if that's helpful.

Everyone:
   - Discuss implementation of editor "hooks".  It would be nice to
     get feedback from the editor for debugging purposes.  [Karl sez:
     not just debugging purposes; possibly we've got ourselves a
     generic hook interface for free now!  Mmm, except are windows a
     convenient enough way to pass content?  Well, probably... after
     all, they're good enough for the rest of Subversion.]

     This needs a more formal writeup, then to the list.

Ben todo:
   - UPDATE the SPEC!!!
   - finish implementing properties.  it's 95% done already.  :)

Karl working copy todo:
   - Preserve local mods on update!!!
   - write the log/lock recovery function.
   - with Ben, review locking protocol in wc adm directories for sanity.
   - make "svn status" work right now, because it's really useful for testing
   - check apr_open calls, do they assume failure implies null handle?
   - work on properties, or work with someone on props
   - fix working copy identification/allergy code
   - make sure type-changing replacements work right

Ben and Karl more later:
   - xml dtd, for both xml deltas and wc formats

   - CURRENT BUGS of the evening:
        * merge_sync can't use varargs; it needs a hash.  When log.c
          tries to execute LOG_MODIFY_ENTRY, it needs to pass "extra"
          attributes (like "reject-file") to merge_sync.
        * for some reason merge_sync isn't setting flags -- at least
          not when flags == 16.  (?)
        * when do we put timestamps into entries?  always?  they're
          being put on "added" files, but not "updated" files right
          now.

Greg:
   - mod_dav_svn:
      - repository hooks. defer mkcol/copy/move/delete.
        !! walking the FS !!  ... needed for checkout

      - liveprop hooks:
	core: getcontentlength, creationdate, getetag,
	      getlastmodified,
	deltav: target

      - vsn hooks: ???  REPORT and MKACTIVITY first
      - deadprop hooks: stub at first

   - mod_dav: no apparent changes until vsn comes in
      - need: MKACTIVITY, MERGE
      - need CHECKOUT, but most of it is there; just verify
      - clean up walker concept

   - libsvn_ra_dav:
      - update editor
      - commit editor

   - APR: move apr_copy_file() from SVN

   - security checks (e.g. system() usage in wc/get_editor)

This file lists immediate, short-term (next few days) stuff on the
stack.  It makes reference to phone conversations and private emails,
so a given item may not make much sense unless you are familiar the
out-of-band context.  We just keep it here because this is a
convenient location.

Karl todo:
   - finish svn_wc__run_log
   - ancestry args to replace_root go away?  Think about this.

Ben todo:
   - update delta/xml_parser.c to use new parser creation stuff
   - crawler

Ben and Karl more later:
   - xml dtd, for both xml deltas and wc formats
   - more tasks for TASKS, if possible

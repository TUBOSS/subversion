If you're looking for a task to take on, please see the TASKS file.

This file merely lists immediate, short-term (next few days) stuff on
people's stacks.  It may make reference to phone conversations and
private emails, so a given item might not make much sense unless one
is familiar with its out-of-band context.  We keep this file under
version control mainly for convenience -- feel free to add your own
short-term tasks to it, if that's helpful.

If you're looking for a task to take on, please see the TASKS file.

This file merely lists immediate, short-term (next few days) stuff on
people's stacks.  It may make reference to phone conversations and
private emails, so a given item might not make much sense unless one
is familiar with its out-of-band context.  We keep this file under
version control mainly for convenience -- feel free to add your own
short-term tasks to it, if that's helpful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ben & Karl todo:
   - make sure textual merging & conflict resolution all works
     correctly, just as it does with properties.

   - once it works, add textual tests to svn-test2.sh

   - come up with a design for `svn_ra.h'

   - clean up the interface in libsvn_client.  make it more canonical.

   - adm_crawler.c:  take an array of paths to traverse, not a single
     path.  if any error happens at any point, abort everything.

   - ? should the update interface also have the same API as above?
     It's not not necessary, since updates aren't atomic like commits.
     But it might be nice for consistency...

   - make a new mini-crawler (lots of shared code with adm_crawler.c)
     which reports "version differences" to an editor.  this will be
     used to communicate the working copy's state to the repository
     *before* receiving an update.

   - trace editor:  trace commits.

Ben todo:
   - update-after-editor: isn't printing `G' for prop merges.  isn't
     printing `C' for either textual or property conflicts.  fix this.

Karl todo:
   - Propagate changes down into libsvn_client.  Currently, the client
     usually takes a `targets' list and iterates over it, invoking
     some libsvn_client routine each time.  There are cases where the
     libsvn_client routine should get the target list directly and do
     the iteration internally, or even pass the list on down into
     libsvn_wc.
   - make an is_textfile test, so at least we can create .alt files
     instead of .rej for those that `patch' can't handle.
   - write the log/lock recovery function.
   - with Ben, review locking protocol in wc adm directories for sanity.
   - check apr_open calls, do they assume failure implies null handle?
   - fix working copy identification/allergy code
   - make sure type-changing replacements work right
   - do the generic entry/adm-path grabber abstraction, as talked
     about with Ben, change everyone around to use it (chore, whoa).

Ben and Karl (longer term):
   - xml dtd, for both xml deltas and wc formats

Greg:
   - mod_dav_svn:
      - finish repository hooks (waiting on FS a bit)
	defer mkcol/copy/move/delete.

      - liveprop hooks:
	core: getcontentlength, creationdate, getetag,
	      getlastmodified,
	deltav: target

      - vsn hooks: ???  REPORT and MKACTIVITY first

   - mod_dav: no apparent changes until vsn comes in
      - need: MKACTIVITY, MERGE
      - verify Vasta's work against our needs: CHECKOUT, REPORT, LABEL

   - libsvn_ra_dav:
      - update editor
      - commit editor

   - APR: move apr_copy_file() from SVN. and apr_append_file, etc.

   - security checks (e.g. system() usage in wc/get_editor)

These are tasks that break down along clean interface boundaries --
everything here will get done eventually, but volunteers will make it
happen faster! :-)  Please email dev@subversion.tigris.org if you want
to take something on.

1. CVS->SVN repository conversion program (or script, whatever).
   Bob Miller <kbob@jogger-egg.com> is working on this, see
   tools/cvs2svn/.


2. Hook up fs w/ Apache, wc w/ libsvn_ra_dav.

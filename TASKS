These are tasks that break down along clean interface boundaries --
everything here will get done eventually, but volunteers will make it
happen faster! :-)  Please email dev@subversion.tigris.org if you want
to take something on.

1. CVS->SVN repository conversion program (or script, whatever).
   Bob Miller <kbob@jogger-egg.com> is working on this, see
   tools/cvs2svn/.


2. Make the working copy library property handling code work.


3. Hook the fs into Apache (becomes higher priority after Milestone 1
   on October 7th).


4. Start writing a basic command-line client, to talk over the network
   to the Apache-connected Subversion server (see 5).


5. Finish the xml outputter in xml.c (hey, this one is doable right
   now -- anyone wanna pick it up?  It's *begging*, can't you hear
   it?... :-)  It will be useful for Milestone 1 and for Bob Miller's
   cvs2svn conversion tool, probably.)

We are very close to creating the 1.5.x branch.  This file lists the
tasks we want to complete before then.  Tasks which are not branch-blockers
should be placed in the issue tracker and given the 1.5 milestone.

  * Make 'svn mergeinfo' error out when talking to a pre-1.5 repository.
    This will allow API consumers to use the API without taking a big
    performance hit for nothing.  We can catch the error and fallback.  [dlr]

  * Either:

       Improve the svn_client_merge() API to actually do
       source-relatedness checks instead of just assuming the sources
       aren't related.  And if they *are* related, normalize the
       sources and run do_merge() like svn_client_merge_peg3() does.
       (See issue #3036 and attached patches.)

    or:

       Document that you cannot get merge tracking functionality from
       svn_client_merge3(), and have it *always* pass FALSE for the
       'sources_related' argument of do_merge().

  * Finish issue #2853 (again, the right way).  [cmpilato]

  * Come up with a heroic plan to save the sqlite database in time for
    1.5, or remove it, remove "svn log -g", and not attempt Issue
    #2897 for 1.5.  Issue #3037.

  * Finish Issue #2897 (reflective merges) and merge the issue-2897
    branch to trunk.  [kameshj]

  * Split the sqlite databases into mergeinfo.sqlite and
    node-origins.sqlite.  Notify mailing list(s) of compatibility
    breakage.  [glasser, 1 hour]

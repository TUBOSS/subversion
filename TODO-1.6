We are getting close to creating the 1.6.x branch.  This file lists the tasks
we want to complete before branching.  "Blocker" tasks must be done before we
branch, while "optional" tasks would be nice to have completed, but aren't
essential.

Tasks which need to happen before the 1.6.0 release, but aren't related to when
we branch should be put in the issue tracker with the 1.6 milestone.

Blocker:
 * Properly wrap BDB rep-sharing code for use in pre-1.6 FS formats, as
   mentioned by cmpilato here: http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-10/0968.shtml


Optional:
 * Merge the sparse-directories deselection branch, as noted by kfogel:

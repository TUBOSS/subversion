We are getting close to creating the 1.6.x branch.  This file lists the tasks
we want to complete before branching.  "Blocker" tasks must be done before we
branch, while "optional" tasks would be nice to have completed, but aren't
essential.

Tasks which need to happen before the 1.6.0 release, but aren't related to when
we branch should be put in the issue tracker with the 1.6 milestone.

Blocker:

 * #3334: Tree conflicts "merry-go-round" about update updating the base.
   Julian Foad is working on this. Done for when victim is a file, still
   doing for when victim is a directory.  [julianfoad]
   See: <http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=1019712>.

 * #3354: update fails when file with local mods is moved and modified.
   The bug has been fixed, but the regression test for the issue seems
   to have problems.

 * Review the new "svn_dirent/svn_uri" API and ensure we aren't putting
   functions into the public name space that we won't want to support.
   See <http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=1010183>.

Optional:

 * Merge the sparse-directories deselection branch, as noted by kfogel:
   http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2008-10/1001.shtml

 * Tree conflicts - essential issues:

   - #3209: Tests XFAIL due to changed tree-conflicts behaviour

 * Tree conflicts - non-essential issues:

   - #3329: Update/switch fails if the target itself is a tree conflict victim.
     Should print a 'Skipped' message instead.  Update of an item that is
     inside a tree conflict, and that no longer exists in the repo, does
     nothing.  Should print a 'Skipped' message instead.

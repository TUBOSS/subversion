This directory contains code that works with Subversion but that
Subversion doesn't depend on, and that is maintained by various
individuals who may or may not participate in Subversion development.
Code in contrib/ is open source, but may have a different license or
copyright holder than Subversion itself.  The Subversion project does
not maintain these programs, but merely distributes them for our
users' convenience.

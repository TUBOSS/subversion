These are scripts that might be useful to run from repository hooks.
Your Mileage May Vary.

   1. check-case-insensitive.pl
      Superceded by check-case-insensitive.py
      in turn superceded by case-insensitive.py for Subversion 1.3.0 and later.

   2. check-case-insensitive.py
      This script makes your repository case insensitive.  It checks if a file
      with the same name but different case already exists in the repository
      and possibly aborts the commit.  This version of the script uses the
      Python language bindings.
      Superceded by case-insensitive.py for Subversion 1.3.0 and later.

   3. check-mime-type.pl
      Force the svn:mime-type and - in case of text files - svn:eol-style
      properties to be in place.

   4. commit-block-joke.pl
      Prevents some committers from committing certain revisions.

   5. pre-commit-check.py
      Template for writing pre-commit checks with the python bindings.

   6. pre-lock-require-needs-lock.py
      Verifies that the path a user is attempting to lock has the
      'svn:needs-lock' property set on it.

   7. svn2rss.py
      Generates a RSS 2.0 file containing commit information.

   8. case-insensitive.py
      This is *much* more efficient than the check-case-insensitive.* scripts
      but it does require Subversion 1.3.0 or later.

   8. enforcer
      This is a pre-commit hook that allows you to more easily specify
      a variety of rules that govern what may be committed to your
      repository.

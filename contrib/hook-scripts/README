These are scripts that might be useful to run from repository hooks.
Your Mileage May Vary.

   1. check-case-insensitive.pl
      This script makes your repository case insensitive (given a
      specific locale): it checks if a file with the same name
      but different case already exists in the repository and possibly
      aborts the commit.

   2. check-mime-type.pl
      Force the svn:mime-type and - in case of text files - svn:eol-style
      properties to be in place.

   3. commit-block-joke.pl
      Prevents some committers from committing certain revisions.

   4. pre-commit-check.py
      Template for writing pre-commit checks with the python bindings.

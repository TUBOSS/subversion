The set of scripts in this directory attempts to fix some kinds of
corruption in a FSFS repository, particularly errors that are reported by
'svnadmin verify' with the following two kinds of error message:

  svnadmin: Corrupt node-revision '5-12980.0.r12980/5571'
  svnadmin: Found malformed header in revision file

  svnadmin: Corrupt representation '13001 1496 2082 16645 [...]'
  svnadmin: Malformed representation header

The files are:

  fix-repo: a Bash script that calls fixer/fix-rev.py on each rev in a range
  fixer/fix-rev.py: checks and fixes if possible a single revision
  fixer/find_good_id.py: a helper function
  fixer/__init__.py: an empty file that signals to Python that this directory
    is a Python module

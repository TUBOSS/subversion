This directory contains the process of designing Inversion. :-)

Once it's settled down, the finished design docs will be migrated to
src/.  For the time being, it's nice to have them over here so that we
don't run into silly file removal issues in an important directory
like src/ (of course, silly file removal issues are one of the things
we hope to fix with with Inversion).

Outline mode is used for `inversion.txt' because we'll be editing it a
lot.  Type "make html" to produce `inversion.html'.

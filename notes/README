This directory contains the process of designing Subversion. :-)

Type

   $ make

to produce subversion.html from subversion.txt (the outline-mode spec).

Once it's settled down, the finished design docs will be migrated to
src/.  For the time being, it's nice to have them over here so that we
don't run into silly file removal issues in an important directory
like src/ (of course, silly file removal issues are one of the things
we hope to fix with with Subversion).

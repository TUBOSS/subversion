TO-DO list for svn 1.2
=======================


CODING TASKS:

   - Slog through Julian Foad's 1.2 API Review email.  (fitz,
     cmpilato, sussman)

   - finish Dan Berlin's streamy-blame stuff;  make it work with libsvn_diff.
     (sander, philip, dberlin?)

   - get win32 build working and passing tests.


BUGS:

   - another issuetracker sweep of 1.2 things?


QUESTIONS:

   - revisit auto-repos-upgrading strategy;  see list discussion.
     proposal:  no lock support until 'svnadmin upgrade', which (1)
     bumps format number and (2) upgrades fs schema in-place.

   - Determine what to do about the fact that if someone schedules a
     file for deletion, and then commits it with the --no-unlock
     switch, the repository will retain a lock on a (now) nonexistent
     path.  One argument is that this is OK as long as we can delete
     the lock via a URL.  The other argument is that, on a delete, the
     lock should be unconditionally deleted.


DOC:

   - write 1.2 CHANGES entry  (sussman, in progress)

   - final tweaks to 1.2 releasenotes (sussman)

   - INSTALL:  explain how to build mod_dav_svn on win32 w/patch


TESTS:

   - we need MORE lock_tests.py test. more, more, more.

   - continue testing various DAV clients against autoversioning.

   - figure out what to do about utf_tests.py #1 once and for all, so
     it passes on *all* systems.


OTHER:

   - push for a 2.0.54 release within the month, so that we don't have
     to require win32 build patch for mod_dav?

   - push for neon 0.25 release?

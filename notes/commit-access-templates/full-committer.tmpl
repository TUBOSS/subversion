Subject: Full commit access to Subversion

Hi New Full Committer,

The other committers and I would like to offer you full commit access
to Subversion.  To accept this offer, please send your tigris.org
username and a htpasswd-crypted password to svnadmin{AT}svn.collab.net.
Alternately, you can set your password yourself
<https://svn.collab.net/wpct/> once your account has been created.
Or, if you already have partial commit access, just reply to this
email and we'll update COMMITERS appropriately (or you can just update
COMMITTERS yourself, that's fine too).

Remember that you can still post patches for review before committing,
when you want to.  Commit access just means that you can rely on your
own judgement to decide when something is ready for commit.  Also, if
you haven't done so already, please read

   http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html

Thanks for all your work so far!

- Some Full Committer

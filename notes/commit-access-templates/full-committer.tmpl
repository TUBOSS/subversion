Subject: Full commit access to Subversion

Hi New Full Committer,

The other committers and I would like to offer you full commit access
to Subversion.  To accept this offer, please send your tigris.org
username and a (plaintext or htpasswd-crypted) password to
svnadmin{AT}svn.collab.net.  Or if you already had partial commit
access, just reply to this and we'll update COMMITERS appropriately
(or you can just update COMMITTERS yourself, that's fine too).

Remember that you can still post patches for review before committing,
when you want to.  Commit access just means that you can rely on your
own judgement to decide when something is ready for commit.  Also, if
you haven't done so already, please read

   http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html

Thanks for all your work so far!

- Some Full Committer

The Berlin '11 hackathon will be held at the elego offices in Berlin, Germany
on May 16-20.  elego has generously donated office space and $BEVERAGE for
the duration of the week, and several committers will be on hand to hack,
discuss, and make themselves merry.

[ should we include an expected attendee list? ]

Potential items for discussion:
 * Let's finish Subversion 1.7
 * What's the plan for 1.8?
 * Key signing
 * ra_serf issues
   - Should we leave serf as default http library?
   - Checkout/update editor memory and performance issues. May be
     it is worth implementing non-skelta update editor mode in ra_serf.
 * The P-word
   - How important is performance of SVN in comparison to other
     qualities like maintainability etc.
   - What is a reasonable long-term performance goal for SVN?
 * 'svn resolve --accept {mine,theirs}-full' for tree conflicts
   - Now that update skips no tree conflicts, we have a fighting chance.
 * Python test timing
   - Identify slow tests
   - Sort tests into short- and long-running sets, for convenience.

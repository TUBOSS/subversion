The Berlin '13 hackathon will be held at the elego offices in Berlin, Germany
on June 10-14.  elego has generously donated office space and $BEVERAGE for
the duration of the week, and several committers will be on hand to hack,
discuss, and make themselves merry.


POTENTIAL ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION
==============================

 * Goals / ideas for Subversion 1.9
   - Are we aiming for a 9 month or rather a 18 month project?
   - Non-binding improvement / feature wishlist
 * Merge
   - Do we need a new data model? How would that look like?
   - What needs to be done for move support?
   - In what aspects can the current merge algorithms / infrastructe be
     improved besides adding merge support?
   - Refactoring our 500+kB merge.c?
 * Branch cleanup
   - Which of the existing branches are obsolete and can be removed?
 * FSFS format 7
   - Goals and feature overview is given as a WebEx talk on Wednesday
   - Technical discussion needs to be separate from that
   - People's feature whishlist
   - How to get that into /trunk? This includes organizing a review
     of the refactoring and improvements for f6. f7 features can be
     disabled (similar to what we do with Ev2 right now).   
 * Shared repository cache
   - A.k.a. "cache server". What it is and why it's useful.
 * How do people feel about C++?
   - GCC recently allowed it in for its own code. What is the general
     opinion amoungst SVN devs toways doing the same?
 * Pipelining the client
   - This seems to be the only available option to make the client
     scale better for large projects.  Is that approach feasible for
     a 1.10+ timeframe and what would it take?
 * Benchmarking
   - How could a systematic scalability and performance test for
     SVN look like?
 * Test coverage
   - Should coverage reports be part of our CI builds?
   - Do we want to improve coverage? If so, where and when?

The SVN Vision meeting will be held on March 24-26 at the GooglePlex
in NYC.  This is a preliminary agenda; feel free to hack it at will.

The general plan is to discuss stuff on March 24, 25, and then spend the
morning of March 26 putting the results together in order to present to dev@.
Most of the anticipated attendees have afternoon flights on March 26, so we'll
then bid each other farewell until Berlin in June.

Potential topics for discussion:
 * Feedback from users we've talked to
 * What is the new Vision for Subversion?
 * Beyond Subversion 1.7 -- a high-level roadmap proposal
 * How do we encourage additional investment (of time, talent, and treasure)?
 * Subversion 2.0 (the Elephant in the Room)

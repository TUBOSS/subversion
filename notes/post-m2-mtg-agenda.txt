   Oh Most Wise and Majestic Emacs, please be in -*- outline -*- mode!


I'm listing here things that we might forget about in the wash of
other stuff at the meeting.  Feel free to add more items, though this
agenda will be probably be only a rough guide anyway.


* Whether to make local operation use the same ra_dav interface.

  Should ra_local continue to exist, or should ra_dav + Apache be used
  even for local access?  There are good arguments on both sides.

  Unifying means a single code path.  This Is Good.

  Having both means you can debug internals independently of the
  network layer.  This Is Also Good.


* Authentication system.

  'Nuff said. :-)


* Change #6:

  Moving data streams to "other side" of the editor.


* Merging and commits:

  The fs provides svn_fs_merge(), ra_dav is doing its own merge &
  conflict checking.  Ben and Greg have been discussing whether having
  these two similar code paths is a good thing, whether to just use
  one or the other, mix them somehow, or what.

  See threads: "transaction roots", "Installation"

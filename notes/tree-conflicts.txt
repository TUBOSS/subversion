This file is a scratch pad for working out current and expected
behaviors for various tree-conflict situations.  It may be considered
unfinished at best -- scatterbrained is more like it.

NOTE:  As Subversion does not actually have real 'move' functionality,
please try to express move-ish use-cases in terms of deletes and
adds-with-history (copies).


UPDATE SCENARIOS
================

'svn update' pulls file deletion atop file with local text mods
  NOW:  file is silently unversioned
  NEW:  file is marked as conflicted

'svn update' pulls file deletion atop file with local prop mods
  NOW:  file is removed and prop mods are forever lost
  NEW:  file is marked as conflicted

'svn update' pulls dir deletion atop dir with local prop mods
  NOW:  directory is removed and prop mods are forever lost
  NEW:  directory is marked as conflicted

'svn update' pulls text mods onto schedule-delete file
  NOW:  text mods are silently merged into file's text-base
  NEW:  file is marked as conflicted

'svn update' pulls dir deletion atop dir containing deep prop mods
  NOW:  directory is removed and prop mods are forever lost
  NEW:  modified items are marked as conflicted

'svn update' pulls dir deletion atop dir containing deep text mods
  NOW:  directory is removed save for modified files (left unversioned)
  NEW:  modified items are marked as conflicted


MERGE SCENARIOS
===============

'svn merge' file deletion
  NOW:  file is unversioned; if not locally modified, it is also deleted
  NEW:  of interest here is not just whether the file is locally
        modified, but if it has been modified at all since the point
        in its history that is the common ancestor of the fork of it
        that was deleted from the merge source.  but what if there was
        no merge source?  or what if the merge is using two
        independent lines of history for its source-left and source-right?

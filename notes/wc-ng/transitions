Delete and revert both operate on WORKING_NODE.presence while leaving
BASE_NODE.presence untouched.

Possible BASE_NODE.presence values:
<none>, normal, incomplete, absent, excluded, not-present

Possible WORKING_NODE.presence values:
<none>, normal, incomplete, absent, excluded, not-present, base-deleted

notes
-----
[1] <none> if the root of the copy, not-present otherwise.
[2] <none> if the root of the copy, - otherwise
[3] A sparse copy, should commit automatically delete an excluded node?
[4] <none> if the root of the copy, - otherwise


Generally BASE_NODE.presence normal and incomplete are treated the
same, since update can change one into the other at any time.

It's not possible to delete something with WORKING_NODE.presence
incomplete unless it's the root of the copy.  If we transformed it to
not-present revert would not be able to go back to incomplete.

It's possible to delete something with BASE_NODE.presence excluded
because the name alone is sufficient information at commit time.

WORKING_NODE.presence excluded is more difficult.  Should commit
automatically delete an excluded node?  There are arguments for and
against.  If commit doesn't automatically delete the node can the user
delete it in the working tree?  Like WORKING_NODE.presence incomplete
the problem is that revert would not be able to cope.

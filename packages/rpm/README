                              RPM GENERATION


This directory contains the scripts necessary (but probably not yet sufficient)
to build the subverion *.i386.rpm and src.rpm files as a non-root user in the
user's home directory.

The ultimate goal is to just type "make" and it will build the latest (or
any) version of the subversion distribution.

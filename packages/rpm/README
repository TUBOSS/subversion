                              RPM GENERATION


This directory contains the scripts necessary and sufficient
to build the subversion*.i386.rpm and subversion*.src.rpm files as a
non-root user in the user's home (rpms) directory.

This build requires certain other packages to be installed.

1.  Requirements

    A. To run:

       apr >= 0.2001.01.19
       db >= 4.0.14
       expat (comes with RedHat)
       neon = 0.18.2
       apache >= 2.0.31 (for subversion-server)

    B. To compile:

       apr-devel >= 0.2002.01.19
       autoconf >= 2.52
       apache >= 2.0.28
       apache-devel >= 2.0.31
       expat-devel
       libtool >= 1.4.2
       neon = 0.18.2
       python >= 1.5.2

    The non-standard packages apr, apache-2.0.31, db, and neon, can be found at:

    http://summersoft.fay.ar.us/pub/linux/RPMS/src

2.  Building a source and binary RPM

    To build the latest release directly from the subversion repository:

    cd ../..; svn update; cd packages/rpm; make

    To make a particular release:

    cd ../..; svn update -r <ReleaseNumber>; cd packages/rpm; make


If you have any questions or problems, please direct them to the
dev@subversion.tigris.org mailing list.  I'm on that list and will help out
if I can.

If you can try compiling RPMS on other platforms, please send email to
david@summersoft.fay.ar.us and I'll help out if I can.  It would be nice to
see RPMS for Solaris Intel and SPARC, SUSE, Caldera, Mandrake, and other
platforms that I don't currently have access to.

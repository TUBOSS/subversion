                              RPM GENERATION


This directory contains the scripts necessary and sufficient
to build the subverion*.i386.rpm and subversion*.src.rpm files as a
non-root user in the user's home directory.

The ultimate goal is to just type "make" and it will build the latest (or
any) version of the subversion distribution.

Right now, you have to type "make rpm RevisionNumber=<Number>" to build the
subversion release you want.

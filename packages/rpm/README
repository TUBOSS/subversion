                              RPM GENERATION


This directory contains the scripts necessary and sufficient
to build the subversion*.i386.rpm and subversion*.src.rpm files as a
non-root user in the user's home (rpms) directory.

This build requires certain other packages to be installed.  In particular,
the apache-2.0.28 or greater is required and the db-4.0.14 or greater is
required.  Here is the current list of required packages:

To run:
apr >= 0.2001.12.18
db >= 4.0.14
expat (comes with RedHat)
neon = 0.18.2
apache >= 2.0.28 (for subversion-server)

To compile:
apr-devel >= 0.2001.12.18
autoconf >= 2.52
apache >= 2.0.28
apache-devel >= 2.0.28
expat-devel
libtool >= 1.4.2
neon = 0.18.2
python >= 1.5.2

The non-standard packages apr, apache-2.0.28, db, and neon, can be found at:

http://summersoft.fay.ar.us/pub/linux/RPMS/ppc
http://summersoft.fay.ar.us/pub/linux/RPMS/src

To build the latest release directly from the subversion repository:

cd ../..; svn update; cd packages/rpm; make

To make a particular release:

cd ../..; svn update -r <ReleaseNumber>; cd packages/rpm; make


If you have any questions or problems, please direct them to the
dev@subversion.tigris.org mailing list.  I'm on that list and will help out
if I can.

If you can try compiling RPMS on other platforms, please send email to
david@summersoft.fay.ar.us and I'll help out if I can.  It would be nice to
see RPMS for Solaris Intel and SPARC, SUSE, Caldera, Mandrake, and other
platforms that I don't currently have access to.

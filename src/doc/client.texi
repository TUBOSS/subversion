@chapter Client

The Subversion client is built on two libraries: one handles working
copy management, the other communicates with the server.  The initial
client is a Unix-style command-line tool (like standard CVS), but there
is no reason why that has to be the only client.  The libraries are
there to separate Subversion-specific functionality from user-interface
decisions; a GUI client can use the libraries as easily as a
command-line client can.

This chapter describes the two libraries, and the layout of working
copies.

todo: note how the network access library is not really network right
now!

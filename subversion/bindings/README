Subversion has a bunch of includes files, some are interesting for
wrapping with language bindings, and others which are simple type
declarations and constants. Below is the table which maps each header
to its disposition:

INCLUDE           SWIG MODULE NAME
svn_base64.h	  n/a (1)
svn_client.h	  client
svn_delta.h	  delta
svn_error.h	  error
svn_fs.h	  fs
svn_hash.h	  n/a (1)
svn_io.h	  io
svn_path.h	  n/a (1)
svn_quoprint.h	  n/a (1)
svn_ra.h	  ra
svn_string.h	  n/a (3)
svn_test.h	  n/a (2)
svn_types.h	  n/a (3)
svn_wc.h	  wc
svn_xml.h	  n/a (1)

apr*.h		  n/a (3)

(1) it is assumed that the binding languages will provide this
    functionality separately.
(2) no significant/interesting functionality to export
(3) only the types are exported; a SWIG interface file is present


NOTE: the bindings code is being developed using SWIG 1.3a5 (it might
be able to work with SWIG 1.1, but the final release target will be
SWIG 1.3)

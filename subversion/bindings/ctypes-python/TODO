The following tasks need to be completed before we release Subversion 1.6.

ctypes-python-bindings TODOs:

 * Teach dist.sh (in Subversion trunk) to download release tarball for
   ctypesgen.

 * Teach Makefile to do in-place build of ctypes-python which do not rely
   on Subversion being installed.  (Might also require some changes to
   setup.py.)

ctypesgen TODOs:

 * Build release tarball of ctypesgen to be used for Subversion 1.6.

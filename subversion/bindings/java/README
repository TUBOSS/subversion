I.     STATUS

       Subversion has two core sets of Java bindings, JavaHL and
       SWIG/Java.  The JavaHL bindings are currently more mature than
       the Java/SWIG bindings, and can be considered for production
       use.


II.    JAVAHL

       See the README under subversion/bindings/java/javahl/ for
       details.


III.   INTERFACES

       The interface code exists to present an API which is familiar
       Subversion Java programmers regardless of the binding
       implementation method.  The SWIG/Java bindings currently
       conform to this interface.  The API is likely to be adjusted to
       more closely align with the JavaHL implementation in hopes of
       its eventual adoption.  If that doesn't work out, it's likely
       that the interface concept will be dropped entirely.


IV.    SWIG

       See the README under subversion/bindings/swig/java/ for details.

I.     STATUS

       Subversion has two core sets of Java bindings, JavaHL and
       SWIG/Java.  The JavaHL bindings are currently more mature than
       the Java/SWIG bindings, and can be considered for production
       use.


II.    BUILDING

       The associated README for each Java bindings implementation is
       the best reference on building.  A few comments apply across
       the board:

       * Passing the --with-maintainer-mode to configure will
         compile Java bytecode with debugging information.

       * Jikes will be the preferred compiler if it is be
         auto-detected.  If not auto-detected, you can force its use
         via the --with-jikes=path flag to configure.


III.   JAVAHL

       See the README under subversion/bindings/java/javahl/ for
       details.


IV.   INTERFACES

       The interface code exists to present an API which is familiar
       Subversion Java programmers regardless of the binding
       implementation method.  You can find it under the org/
       sub-directory.  The SWIG/Java bindings currently conform to
       this interface.  The API is likely to be adjusted to more
       closely align with the JavaHL implementation in hopes of its
       eventual adoption.  If that doesn't work out, it's likely that
       the interface concept will be dropped entirely.


IV.    SWIG

       See the README under subversion/bindings/swig/java/ for details.

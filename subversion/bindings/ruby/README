This directory used to contain a set of Ruby bindings which were
hand-built. They became completely stale and confused people by
their presence, so the bindings were removed in revision 6485.

If you want to see them and try working with them, then pull
them from a previous release. See extconf.rb in this directory
for building the old bindings.

For the future, it is highly recommended that a Ruby developer
work on developing SWIG-based bindings. The SWIG-based bindings
have been able to stay *much* more up to date with much less
human intervention.

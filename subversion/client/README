The client for milestone 1 is somewhat limited: it can checkout and
update from XML files, and commit to XML files.  The changes it can
make in a working copy are file mods and file adds.

So:

   svn checkout -d TARGETDIR --xml-file FILE.XML

   svn update --xml-file FILE.XML

   svn commit --xml-file FILE.XML --version 38 [FILE1 [FILE2...]]

(The --version flag is necessary for commits because we're not
actually talking to the repository yet.  So the user has to know what
new version number the repository would hand back, were it actually
being contacted.)

If you check out into TARGETDIR, that directory must exist and be
either empty, or be an appropriate working copy (but this latter
condition may be an error in milestone 1).

The code here uses `svn_cl_' as a namespace prefix -- it stands for
"command line".

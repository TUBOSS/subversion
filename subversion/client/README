The client for milestone 1 is somewhat limited: it can checkout and
update from XML files, and commit to XML files.  The changes it can
make in a working copy are file mods and file adds.

So:

 svn checkout -d TARGETDIR --xml-file FILE.XML --ancestor-path blah --version N
 svn update --xml-file FILE.XML
 svn add FILE
 svn delete [--force] FILE
 svn commit --xml-file FILE.XML --version N

You may be wondering why the --ancestor-path and --version are on the
command line.  Don't worry, they won't be in a real-life client.  The
issue right now is that the client and server aren't actually talking
to one another, so information that they would have exchanged has to
be passed manually, by a human (excuse me, I mean by a developer).

If you check out into TARGETDIR, that directory must exist and be
empty.

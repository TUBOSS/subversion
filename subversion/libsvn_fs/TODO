Get rid of proplists; just give the user an APR hash table instead.

The delta algorithm walks the whole tree using a single pool, so the
memory used is proportional to the size of the target tree.  Instead,
it should use a separate subpool every time it recurses into a new
directory, and free that subpool as soon as it's done processing that
subdirectory, so the memory used is proportional to the depth of the
tree.

Probably file contents should be stored in a separate record from the
REPRESENTATION and NODE-VERSION skel, so we can parse those skels
without having to read the whole file's data.

svn_fs__getsize shouldn't rely on a maximum value for detecting
overflow.

The use of svn_fs__getsize in svn_fs__parse_id is ugly --- what if
svn_vernum_t and apr_size_t aren't the same size?

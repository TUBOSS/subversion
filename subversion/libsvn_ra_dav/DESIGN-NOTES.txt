ACTIVITIES
----------

### how activities are used...

The location for activities was found via PROPFIND on each collection,
and then stored locally as a directory property (in a canonical-path
form). At commit time, we pick up the property and use it for creating
our activity.

[ should we have a custom property store for RA-specific props?
  (rather than pretending they are "real" dirprops) ]

This library contains pieces of functionality which are built on top
of libsvn_fs (using the API in svn_fs.h).

While these tools aren't strictly part of the filesystem, they are
most often needed by users of the filesystem (the RA libraries in
particular.)


 -- For a list of all exported funcs, see 'svn_repos.h' --


  delta.c:          code that compares two filesystem trees, and then
                    describes a delta by driving an editor.  This is
                    the "soul" of the update command.

  commit-editor.c:  if you drive this editor, it will build a transaction
                    for you, and close_edit() will commit it.

  reporter.c:       code to build a transaction that 'mirrors' a
                    working copy, so that svn_fs_dir_delta() can drive
                    an update.

  ?hooks.c:         hook system, called by "cooperative" users of the fs.

  ?lock.c:          cross-process read/write lock manager, to temporarily
                    suspend all db3 access when DB_RUN_RECOVERY is
                    returned.

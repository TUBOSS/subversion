This is the Subversion Server library.

This library depends on the Subversion filesystem library (libsvn_fs),
and provides an interface to any program that wishes to behave as a
Subversion server.

With this library, your program is able to:

     * make filesystem calls into any Subversion repository

     * define general server policy behavior and load server-side
       plugins by writing a custom `svn.conf' file


The public API is defined in `svn_svr.h'.


---------------------------------

How to use the library:


    * create a svn_user_t structure.  you're responsible for making
      sure the represented user is authenticated;  the subversion
      filesystem just assumes so.

    * call svn_svr_init ("/etc/svn.conf"), returns a policy context
      structure.  pass this structure to all future routines.

    * call any number of wrappered filesystem calls, passing in the
      user structure and the policy structure.  if you care about
      authorization, use the basic 'plugin_security' plugin in
      `svn.conf', else write your own authorization plugin.

This is the library described in the section "The working copy
management library" of svn-design.texi.

It performs local operations in the working copy, tweaking
administrative files and versioned data.  It has no concept of network
nor of server -- that's libsvn_cl's job.

For now, I'll document the wc administrative (SVN/*) file formats
here, instead of in ../../doc/client.texi.  Once the formats have
stabilized and have code written around them, this documentation will
be moved to client.texi.

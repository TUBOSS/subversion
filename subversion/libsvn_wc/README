     Oh Most High and Fragrant Emacs, please be in -*- text -*- mode!

This is the library described in the section "The working copy
management library" of svn-design.texi.

It performs local operations in the working copy, tweaking
administrative files and versioned data, generally in response to a
received delta.  It has no concept of network nor of server -- that's
libsvn_cl's job.

The Situation:
==============

The working copy is arranged as a directory tree, which, at checkout,
mirrors a tree rooted at some node in the repository.  Over time, the
working copy accumulates uncommitted changes, some of which may affect
its tree layout.  By commit time, the working copy's layout could be
arbitrarily different from the repository tree on which it was based.

Worse, even after an update/commit, the working copy and the
repository are not necessarily perfect mirrors, since updates leave
local changes, and updates/commits don't always involve the entire
working copy.

To resolve all situations safely, we must carefully define what
constitutes a "conflict" between a repository and a working copy, and
describe how such conflicts are resolved.

The principles and definitions below do not presume any particular
tree delta format; the semantics require merely that working copies
and repositories have some way to communicate their `state' to each
other.

  * Modifying a file's contents is a change to that file only.

  * Renames, adds, and deletes are considered changes to *both* the
    target entity and its parent.

  * A working copy's "state" is a snapshot (maybe as a skelta?) that
    shows the base versions, and any changes, for all entities in the
    working copy.

  * A repository's "state", relative to a particular working copy
    state, is a list of all entities that have changed w.r.t. that wc
    state.

  * Two changes "conflict" if they change the same thing.

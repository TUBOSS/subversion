/* About this file:
   This file is meant to be a stash of fairly low-level functions used by both
   wc_db.c and wc_db_pdh.c.  In breaking stuff out of the monolithic wc_db.c,
   I have discovered that some utility functions are used by bits in both
   files.  Rather than shoehorn those functions into one file or the other, or
   create circular dependencies between the files, I felt a third file, with
   a well-defined scope, would be sensible.  History will judge its effect.

   The goal of it file is simple: just execute SQLite statements.  That is,
   functions in this file should have no knowledge of pdh's or db's, and
   should just operate on the raw sdb object.  If a function requires more
   information than that, it shouldn't be in here.  -hkw

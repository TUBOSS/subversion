I.    Installation

      mod_authz_svn will be installed alongside mod_dav_svn when the regular
      installation instructions are followed.

      NOTE: the module is functional, but you should consider it experimental.
      Some configurations may or may not have the desired effect.  Be sure
      to test if your configuration works as intended.


II.   Configuration

   1. Configuring Apache

      Modify your httpd.conf.  Add the following line _after_ the one that
      loads mod_dav_svn:

        LoadModule authz_svn_module   modules/mod_authz_svn.so


      Next set up your subversion location like so:

        <Location /svn>
          DAV svn
          SVNPath /path/to/repos

          AuthType Basic
          AuthName "Subversion repository"
          AuthUserFile /path/to/htpasswd/file

          AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file

          Require valid-user
        </Location>

      NOTE: Authentication is always required using mod_authz_svn for all
      methods you wish to protect.  This means you need a dummy 'anonymous'
      account for anonymous read only users now, if you want to be able
      to restrict reading of any portion of the repository.

   2. Specifying permissions

      The file format of the access file looks like this:

        [groups]
        <groupname> = <user>[,<user>...]
        ...

        [<path in repository>]
        @<group> = [rw|r]
        <user> = [rw|r]
        * = [rw|r]


      An example (line continued lines are supposed to be on one line):

        [groups]
        subversion = jimb,sussman,kfogel,gstein,brane,joe,ghudson,fitz, \
                     daniel,cmpilato,kevin,philip,jerenkrantz,rooneg, \
                     bcollins,blair,striker,naked,dwhedon,dlr,kraai,mbk, \
                     epg,bdenny,jaa
        subversion-doc = nsd,zbrown,fmatias,dimentiy,patrick
        subversion-bindings = xela,yoshiki,morten,jespersm,knacke
        subversion-rm = mprice
        ...and so on and so on...

        [/]
        # Allow everyone read on the entire repository
        * = r
        # Allow devs with blanket commit to write to the entire repository
        @subversion = rw

        [/trunk/doc]
        @subversion-doc = rw

        [/trunk/subversion/bindings]
        @subversion-bindings = rw

        [/branches]
        @subversion-rm = rw

        [/tags]
        @subversion-rm = rw

        [/branches/issue-650-ssl-certs]
        mass = rw

        [/branches/pluggable-db]
        gthompson = rw

        ...

        [/secrets]
        # Just for demonstration
        * =
        @subversion = rw

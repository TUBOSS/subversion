            Test suite for the command line client.
            =======================================

Currently, the command line client lives in ../../../client/, for
historical reasons, and is the only testable Subversion client.
Eventually, though, it will live in ../../../clients/cmdline/, and be
one of many clients; that's why the test dir is tests/clients/cmdline/
instead of tests/client/.

The cmdline client test suite doesn't use the C-level testing
framework.  Instead, it drives the client just like a user would,
examining the output and the on-disk results (i.e., the working copy)
carefully as it goes.

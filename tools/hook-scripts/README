These are scripts that might be useful run from repository hooks.
Your Mileage May Vary.

[note to self: as long as these are small and simple, perhaps they
should just be put into repository custom/ dir when the repos is
created?  Hmmm.]

Contents:

   1. commit-email.pl
      Uses the `svnlook' program to send commit emails.  Invoke it
      from `repository/hooks/post-commit'.  Run the script with no
      arguments for usage.

   2. commit-access-control.pl and commit-access-control.cfg
      Uses the `svnlook' program to check if check if the user that
      submitted the commit has appropriate rights to perform the
      commit on all the modified files and directories using the
      permissions specified in the configuration file.

      The commit-access-control.cfg is a sample configuration file
      that you should modify for your own use.

Using the svntest scripts                                 -*- Text -*-
=========================

1) Read the INSTALL (http://svn.collab.net/repos/svm/trunk/INSTALL)
   file, especially the sections about bootstrapping from a tarball
   and getting the latest APR, APR-UTIL and httpd-2.0 sources.
   Check out and compile the latest Subversion.

2) Copy the svntest scripts from trunk/tools/test-scripts/svntest to
   somewhere outside the repository. Then read and modify
   svntest-config.sh to reflect your local installation. Take special
   care about program locations and e-mail addresses.

3) Create one or more scripts that configure Subversion in different
   ways (e.g., configure.shared, configure.static). Here's the script
   I'm using for static builds on Solaris 7:

   #!/bin/sh
   env CC='gcc' \
       "../repo/configure" \
       "--prefix=/home/brane/svn/inst" \
       "--with-berkeley-db=/home/brane/svn/db4" \
       "--disable-shared" \
       "$@"

   At the moment, svntest-rebuild.sh will only recognize shared and
   static build types, but you can easily change that. If you do, also
   change svntest.sh so that it tests all the different configurations.

4) Make sure your environment (e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH) is set correctly
   to find Berkeley DB, etc.

5) Run svntest.sh to get the latest versions of ARP, APR-UTIL and
   Subversion, build and test all the configurations. Note that the
   scripts do not test Apache integration (yet).

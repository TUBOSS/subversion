Subversion Inconveniences
</h1>
</center>

<p>

Subversion is in pre-Alpha state, and there are plenty of known bugs
(see the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issues</a>
page for a complete list).  Frankly, you should probably read over all
the open issues.  But since you're probably not going to do that, we
list below some of the ones most likely to annoy you, and their
workarounds.  These will be fixed soon, sooner the more people are
working on them (hint, hint).

<p>

<ol>
   <li><b>"svn up" fails if too much svndiff data received.</b>
   <p>
   While we speculate that the problem is with neon not being able
   handle certain large request results properly, we're not really
   sure.  What we do know is that when doing an update of the working
   copy, you might see:
   <p>
   <pre>
   svn_error: #21073 : <RA layer's server request failed>
     The REPORT request failed (/repos/svn/trunk/doc/.)

   svn_error: #21073 : <RA layer's server request failed>
     neon: Could not read response body: connection was closed by server.
   </pre>
   <p>
   Obvious fixes include updating invidual file targets (in theory, to
   make the responses to the update request smaller), or re-checking
   out your working copy.
   <p>
   See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=472">
   Issue #472</a> for more details.
   </li>
 <p>
   <li><b>Checkout of url ending in slash ("/") makes a lossy wc.</b>
   <p>
   This is a buglet we have seen before and just not gotten around to
   fixing.  Please be careful (for now) to leave off the trailing
   slash from the URLs you use in checking out from a Subversion
   repository.  Should be a trivial fix.
   <p>
   See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=471">
   Issue #471</a> for more details.
   </li>
 <p>
   <li><b>Bug in nested wc deletions.</b><br>
   Ah, the joys and pains of versioning directories.  If you delete a
   directory, please commit the whole directory, not just one of the
   (deleted) subtrees.  Your working copy will thank you.
   <p>
   See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=387">
   Issue #387</a> for more details.
   </li>
 <p>
   <li><b>can't check out arbitrary revisions, only head</b>
   <p>
   Pretty self-explanatory.  Yes, this is a <i>major</i> annoyance,
   and is up near the top of the list of post-M3 fixes.
   <p>
   See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=411">
   Issue #411</a> for more details.

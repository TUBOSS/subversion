Inversion: Version Control Rethought

<p>
The goal of the Inversion project is to build a version control system
that is a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community.
This system will have the following features:
</p>

<ul>  <!-- list of features -->

<li><strong>All current CVS features.</strong>
    <p>
    CVS is good, as far as it goes, so we want to keep
    feature-compatibility: versioning, folding of non-conflicting
    changes, detection of conflicting changes, branching, merging,
    historical diffs, log messages, line-by-line history (<tt>cvs
    annotate</tt>), etc.
    <p>
    Generally, Inversion's conceptual interface to a particular
    feature will be as similar to CVS's as possible, except where
    there's a compelling reason to do otherwise.
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Directories, renames, and file meta-data are versioned.</strong>
    <p>
    Lack of these features is the most common complaint against CVS --
    basically, CVS only versions file contents.  Inversion will handle
    directory changes, file renames, and permission and other
    meta-data changes as well.
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Symbolic links, etc, are supported</strong>
    <p>
    Inversion will handle symbolic links ("shortcuts"), multiple hard
    links, and other special file types as long as their semantics are
    compatible with version control.
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Commits are truly atomic.</strong>
    <p>
    No part of a commit takes effect until the entire commit has
    succeeded.  Revision numbers are per-commit, not per-file.
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Internationalization</strong>
    <p>
    Inversion will have I18N support -- commands, user messages, and
    errors can be customized to the appropriate human language at
    build-time.
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Progressive multi-lingual support</strong>
    <p>
    In order to support keyword expansion and platform-dependent
    line-ending conversion, CVS makes a distinction between text and
    binary files, and treats the text files specially.
    <p>
    Inversion will make the same distinction, but with a more generous
    notion of what constitutes a text file: not only ASCII, but UTF-*
    encodings of Unicode too.  Not all such encodings will be handled
    as text in the first release of Inversion, but the support will
    become more complete over time.  UTF-8 is the first priority.
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Branching and tagging are cheap (constant time) operations</strong>
    <p>
    There is no reason for these operations to be expensive, so they
    aren't.
    <p>
    Branches and tags will both be implemented in terms of an
    underlying "clone" operation.  A clone is just an alias pointing
    at a specific revision of an existing project, so it takes up a
    small, constant amount of space.  All clones are tags; if you
    start committing on one, then it's a branch as well.
    <p>
    (This obviates the need for "branch-point tags" in CVS, by doing
    away with the artificial distinction that made them necessary in
    the first place.)
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Repeated merges are handled gracefully</strong>
    <p>
    Inversion will have a way of remembering what has been merged, so
    that repeated merges from the same source do not require careful
    human calculation to avoid spurious conflicts (anyone who's done
    repeated CVS merges knows what we're talking about).
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Support for plug-in client side diff programs</strong>
    <p>
    Inversion knows how to show diffs for text files, and also gives
    the user the option to plug in external diff programs for any kind
    of file.  The external program need merely conform to some simple
    interface (i.e., "<tt>diffprog file1 file2 [file3...]</tt>", where
    the various files might be different revisions of the same file)
    for Inversion to invoke it.
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Natively client/server</strong>
    <p>
    Inversion is designed to be client/server from the beginning; thus
    it will avoid some of the maintenance problems which have plagued
    CVS.
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Client/server protocol sends diffs in both directions</strong>
    <p>
    The network protocol uses bandwidth efficiently by transmitting
    diffs in both directions whenever possible (CVS sends diffs from
    server to client, but not client to server).  The protocol will
    support compression too, of course.
</li>

<p>

<li><strong>Costs are proportional to change size, not project size</strong>
    <p>
    In general, the time required for an Inversion operation is
    proportional to the size of the <i>changes</i> resulting from that
    operation, not to the absolute size of the project in which the
    changes are taking place.  This is a property of the Inversion
    repository model.
</li>

</ul>  <!-- end list of features -->

<p>
Many people have expressed interest in doing a new version control
system, and doing it right.  Inversion aims to be that system.
Mailing lists, CVS repositories, and bugzilla are set up.
</p>

<p>
We are using CVS as an interim source code control system for
Inversion, and getting Inversion to a point where it is stable enough
to hold itself is one of our immediate goals (a read-only CVS mirror
will be continued for some time after that, of course).

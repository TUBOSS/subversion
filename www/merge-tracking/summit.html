<h2>CollabNet Merge Tracking Summit</h2>

<p>On Tuesday, January 17th, CollabNet held a merge tracking summit
for some of their Subversion-using customers to solicit use cases and
requirements for the enterprise.  Enterprise level users have branches
which last longer than a typical open source project (e.g. more than a
decade). They tend to do merges more often, involving more files. They
also have a greater need for auditability/traceability (e.g. FDA
requirements, Sarbanes Oxley compliance, etc.).</p>

<p>The pre-summit <a href="summit-survey.html">survey questionnaire
and responses</a>, and the <a href="#summit-results">recorded
results</a> of that summit are available here.</p>

<h3>Summit Results</h3>

<p>Partial results below.  Content is not yet in any particular
order.</p>

<!-- TODO: Incorporate feedback from rooneg, cmpilato, djames, and
dlr.  Better organize and flesh out content. -->

<ul>
  <li>The ability to manually adjust any merge meta data is crucial.
  For instance, someone may hand-edit one or more resources to achieve
  the same result as a merge, or hand-edit the result of a merge in a
  way which significantly alters the change.  Either way, one might
  still want to represent that the change does still exist in the
  target line.  In general, humans who claim that they know better
  than the tool should be trusted.</li>

  <li>The question "What branches contain this exact version of file
  X?" is important.  (In Subversion, that would be "What paths contain
  this exact version of X?")  This may imply exposing some sort of
  unique object identifier, more than we offer so far.</li>

  <li>Same as above, but for changes: "What branches include change
  C?"</li>

  <li>The ability to push a given change out to multiple branches.
  Selection mechanisms for destinations should be sophisticated.  For
  example, select all branches that have a common ancestor with the
  source branch of the change, all branches except an exclusion set,
  all branches matching a regular expression, etc.  The medical
  systems manufacturer does this type of operation daily.</li>

  <li>Surprisingly, <code>svn blame</code> improvements were not a high
  priority.  The current output (which presumably would show the
  revision in which a merge took place, rather than the original
  source revision), was deemed generally okay.  Possibly, revisions
  which are marked as merges should be displayed as such, so that the
  user knows to drill down further.</li>

  <li>A portable, human-readable change format for review would be
  useful.  Programmatic parsability was not a high priority,
  however.  An extended patch program was not considered crucial.</li>

  <li>Visual interfaces to branch/merge management are <em>very</em>
  useful.  TODO: Follow-up sessions via WebEx will add more detail
  here.</li>

  <li>The ability to do foreign branch is very good (for similar
  reasons to those in the open source world -- many commercial
  organizations are adopting open source-style practices
  internally).</li>

  <li>Partial change merging: The merge meta data itself should be
  atomic.  We record that you either applied a whole change, or
  not.  Of course, hand edits and the log message may tell a more
  detailed story.</li>

  <li>Edited merges should be disentanglable and viewable as separate
  pieces, i.e. [merge] + [edits].  However, this was a nice-to-have
  than a must-have.</li>

  <li>An option to merging to say "If anything conflicted, then show
  all merged regions in a conflicted style, even those which did not
  conflict."</li>

  <li>TortoiseSVN merge is apparently good (it has the Araxis
  Merge-style take my version or their version), but needs a built-in
  text editor for more involved conflict resolution.</li>

  <li>Format-specific merge tools is an important need.</li>

  <li>The ability to automate merges, including interfaces for
  resolving conflicts and handling other errors, is important.
  Customers who do multi-thousand file merges stress this.</li>

  <li>Questions users want to ask: "Is this version of foo.c the
  'latest' version?  Are there changes out there which are applicable
  to foo.c, that have not been applied?  What are they?"</li>

  <li>Any action that can be done to a tag/branch (e.g. merge a
  change, remove a change, etc.) should be hook-protected.</li>

  <li>The ability to "shadow" versioned resources: Make a branch, but
  have most of the branch follow the original source, while only a few
  files are selected for branch development (e.g. "unshadowed").  Is
  this different from systems which allow you to branch individual
  resources in the first place?  Can this be achieved with a
  finer-grained <code>svn switch</code>?  Note: This is related to the
  shared file storage issue in Subversion's own issue tracker (TODO:
  link to issue).</li>

  <li>Roll-back should be convenient, and should be recorded as a
  subtraction event, visible as such in the meta data.  Roll-back was
  common at Google, and more rare at other shops.</li>

  <li>Asking change C to where it has been ported was not a strong
  need (e.g. reporting).</li>

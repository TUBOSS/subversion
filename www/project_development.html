<h2>Subversion Development</h2>
</center>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>Subversion development discussion takes place on the mailing list
<a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>.
You don't need to subscribe to the list just to submit a patch or two,
but if you want to be involved with Subversion development on a
regular basis, you should probably subscribe.  It's high-traffic, but
threading tends to be fairly disciplined, so you can ignore
conversations you aren't interested in.  For real-time chat,
developers use the same IRC channel as everyone else: <a
href="irc://irc.freenode.net/svn">irc.freenode.net/svn</a>.</p>

<p>The <b>HACKING</b> file contains developer guidelines, see:</p>

<ul>
   <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/HACKING"
           >http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/HACKING</a>
</ul>

<p>There you can find information about submitting patches, learning
your way around the code, interacting with other developers, project
governance, etc.  If you don't see the answers you need there, please
ask on the mailing list or in IRC, we're happy to help.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">What Needs Doing?</h1>

<p>There are a lot of different things you can do to help Subversion.
Not all involve coding; there are plenty of non-programming roles for
eager volunteers.</p>

<p>Below are some of the needs we've identified, but please don't take
these as gospel!  New volunteers bring fresh viewpoints, and one of
the most important things you can do is point out a need we hadn't
recognized before&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and then fill it.</p>

<h3>Issue Management</h3>

<p>Do we need an Issue Manager?  Maybe...</p>

<p>The Subversion <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_issues.html">bug
database</a> has been managed in a rather ad hoc fashion thus far.
Periodically we make sweeps over all outstanding issues and try to
prioritize them, organize them into scheduled milestones, note
dependencies between issues, etc.  These methods have been moderately
successful up till now, but they are not scaling well as the number of
issues grows.  Since issue growth is proportional to user base growth,
the issue tracker is becoming a victim of Subversion's success.  We
need to find new ways of managing our issues, ways that do not involve
making O(N) sweeps over the entire list of open issues at regular
intervals.</p>

<p>While we have some semi-formalized management roles (patch manager,
release manager, etc), we have never had an issue manager.  It might
be time to get one, though.  It's not yet clear whether the problem is
mainly one of attention, or of algorithm, or both, but having someone
dedicated to managing the issues database couldn't hurt.  One thing
such a person could do would be to go through the list of outstanding
issues, figure out which ones are likely to be <a
href="#bite-sized">bite-sized tasks</a>, and mark them as such, so
that other volunteers have an easier time choosing things to work on.
We've already marked various issues as bite-sized, but we haven't done
so consistently as new issues come in.  This means there are a lot of
potential entry points to the project going unnoticed.  Want to help
us solve that?</p>

<p>Creative ideas welcome!  If you'd like to help with this, please <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"
>subscribe</a> to the <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>
mailing list and post your thoughts.</p>

<div class="h3" id="faq-management" title="faq-management">
<h3>FAQ Management</h3>

<p>We need a FAQ manager.  A FAQ manager is someone who stays
subscribed to the <a
href="mailto:users@subversion.tigris.org">users@subversion.tigris.org</a>
and <a href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org"
>dev@subversion.tigris.org</a> mailing lists, watches for common
questions or addenda to existing questions, and slowly adjusts the
Subversion <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> in response to the problems
users are having "in the wild".  This is also a great way to get
familiar with Subversion usage patterns and common problems.  If you
use or administrate Subversion anyway, helping to manage the FAQ is a
great way to expand your troubleshooting skills.</p>

<p>Again, creative ideas are most welcome.  Please post to the <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>
mailing list if you're interested in this.</p>

<h2>Bite-Sized Coding Tasks</h2>

<!-- ============================================================= -->

<p>The Subversion bug database contains many issues classified as
"bite-sized" tasks&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;tasks that are well-defined and
self-contained, and thus suitable for a volunteer looking to get
involved with the project.  You <i>don't</i> need broad or detailed
knowledge of Subversion's design to take on one of these, just a
pretty good idea of how things generally work, and familiarity with
the coding guidelines in the <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/HACKING"><tt>HACKING</tt></a>
file.  Each task is something a volunteer could pick off in a spare
week or two, and it's a great way to start learning your way around
the Subversion code.</p>

<p> If you start one of these tasks, please notify the other
developers by marking the issue as "STARTED" in the issue tracker,
then mail <a
href="mailto:dev@subversion.tigris.org">dev@subversion.tigris.org</a>
(<a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"
>subscribe</a> to that list too) with questions.  Don't be shy, it's a
very civil mailing list.</p>

<p>When you're ready to send in a patch, see the <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/mailing-list-guidelines.html#patches"
>patch posting guidelines</a>.  Don't be discouraged if your patch
goes through several iterations of review by other developers; this is
normal.</p>

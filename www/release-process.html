<h2>Being the Release Manager</h2>

<p>The role of the Release Manager in the Subversion project is to
handle the process of getting code stabilized, packaged and released
to the general public.  If we were building planes, the RM would be
the guy looking at the construction checklists, painting the airline
logo on the fuselage, and delivering the finished unit to the
customer.</p>

<p>As such, there is no real development associated with being an RM.
All the work you have to do is non-coding: coordinating people,
centralizing information, and being the public voice announcing new
stable releases.  A lot of the tasks that the RM has to do are
repetitive, and not automated either because nobody has broken down
and written the tools yet, or because the tasks require human
validation that makes automation a little superfluous.</p>

<p>You may be thinking at this stage that the RM's duty is
unglamorous, and you are kinda right.  If you are looking for a
position within the project that will bring fame and fortune, you're
better off implementing stuff that really needs to be done on trunk.
If you're looking for something that really helps people who don't
care about releases focus on code, then RMing is for you.</p>

<p>So, you are the Release Manager.  What do you need to do?  This is
what the rest of this document is about.</p>

</div>

<div class="h2" id="release-branches" title="release-branches">
<h2>Creating and maintaining release branches</h2>

<p>A new release branch is created for each new major and minor
release.  So, for example, a new release branch is created when
preparing to release version 2.0.0, or version 1.3.0.  However, when
preparing to release 1.3.1 (a patch-version increment), the release
branch created at the time of 1.3.0 is used.</p>

<p>If you are preparing for a patch release, then there is no release
branch to create. You just pick up where you left off in the current
minor version series release branch.</p>

<p>The time at which a new release branch needs to be created is fuzzy
at best.  Generally, we have a soft schedule of releasing a new minor
version every 6 months.  So, approximately 4 months after the previous
minor release is a good time to start proposing a branch. But remember
that this is flexible, depending on what features are being
developed.</p>

<p>Once people agree that a new release branch should be made, the
Release Manager creates it with the following procedure (substitute
A.B with the version you're preparing, eg. 1.3, or 2.0):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create the new release branch with a server-side copy:</p>
    <pre>
      svn cp http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk \
             http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/A.B.x \
             -m "Create A.B.x release branch."
    </pre></li>

<li><p>Edit <tt>subversion/include/svn_version.h</tt> on trunk and
    increment the version numbers there.  Do not commit these changes
    yet.</p>
    <p>The version number on trunk always reflects the major/minor
    version that will immediately follow the one for which you just
    created a branch (eg. 2.1.0 for the 2.0.x branch, and 1.4.0 for
    the 1.3.x branch).</p></li>

<li><p>Edit <tt>CHANGES</tt> on trunk to introduce a new section for the
    upcoming release.  The section starts with:</p>
    <pre>
      Version A.B.0 (released ?? ????? 200X, from /branches/A.B.x)
      http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/A.B.0
    </pre>
    <p>Leave the release date blank for now. It will remain this way
    until rolling time.</p></li>

<li><p>Commit both these changes with the following log message:</p>
    <pre>
      Increment the trunk version number, and introduce a new CHANGES
      section for the upcoming A.B.0 release.

      * subversion/include/svn_version.h: Increment version number.

      * CHANGES: New section for A.B.0.
    </pre></li>
</ul>

<div class="h2" id="porting-changes" title="porting-changes">
<h2>Porting changes to release branches</h2>

<p>Once a release branch has been created, no development <i>ever</i>
takes place there.  The only changes permitted are ones made to
various bookkeeping files such as <tt>STATUS</tt>, and changes merged
in from trunk.</p>

<p>The protocol used to accept or refuse the merging of changes from
trunk is of interest to all Subversion developers, and as such is
documented in <a
href="hacking.html#release-stabilization">the
release stabilization section of the hacking guide</a>.</p>

<div class="h2" id="the-changes-file" title="the-changes-file">
<h2>Managing the CHANGES file</h2>

<p>The <tt>CHANGES</tt> file is the project changelog file.  Before a
release, it must be brought up to date to list all changes since the
last release.</p>

<p>For patch-releases, this is fairly easy: you just need to walk
through the commit logs for the branch since the last "golden"
revision, and note all interesting merges.  For minor and major
releases, this is more complex: you need to traverse the commit log on
<em>trunk</em> since the last release branch was forked, and make note
of all changes there.  It's the same procedure, but a lot longer, and
somewhat more complex as it involves filtering out changesets that
have already been backported to previous release branches and released
from there.</p>

<p>Remember that <tt>CHANGES</tt> should <em>always</em> be edited on
trunk and then merged over to the release branch(es) when necessary.
It is very important that all changes of all releases be documented in
the CHANGES file on trunk, both for future reference and so that
future release branches contain the sum of all previous change
logs.</p>

<p>Keep the bullet point for each change concise, preferably no more
than one line long.  Sometimes that can be a challenge, but it really
adds to the overall readability of the document.  Think to yourself:
<i>If it takes more than one line to describe, maybe I'm getting too
detailed?</i></p>

<div class="h3" id="writing-initial-changes" title="writing-initial-changes">
<h3>Writing the initial content for a branch</h3>

<p>Run <code>svn log -rHEAD:BRANCH_POINT
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/A.B.x</code>,where
BRANCH_POINT is the revnum where the previous major/minor release was
branched off of the trunk.  This should give you every change ever
made to the A.B.x line, including backports made to the A.B.x branch.
You then need to <em>remove</em> logs of changes that have already
been released in micro releases of the previous major/minor branch.
Run <code>svn log -q --stop-on-copy</code> on the previous release
branch, and then write a script to parse the revnums and remove them
from your primary log output.  (Karl and Ben used to use emacs macros
to do that, but suggest that we write a more general script.)</p>

<p>Read that log from oldest to newest, summarizing points as you go.
The trick is to know what level of detail to write at: you don't want
to mention every tiny little commit, but you don't want to be too
general either.  Set your filter-level by reading through a few pages
of the CHANGES file before starting on the new section, just to keep
things consistent.</p>

<h2>Preparing to roll a release</h2>

<p>So, a release branch has stabilized, and you are gearing up to roll
the release.  Before you can actually roll the archives, you need to
set up a white-room rolling environment.  This environment must
contain pristine versions of some build tools, as well as all the
relevant dependancies and other stuff that gets bundled into a
release tarball.</p>

<p>You need to grab vanilla source tarballs of the following build
tools before proceeding:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The latest Autoconf (2.59 at the time of writing)</p></li>
<li><p>The latest Libtool (1.5.22 at the time of writing)</p></li>
<li><p>A known supported version of SWIG (1.3.25 at the time of
    writing)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that you do not use distribution shipped versions
of this software as they are often patched in ways that are not
portable.</p>

<p>Also grab the following source tarballs, parts of which will be
bundled in the Subversion release packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The latest Unix APR and APR-util of the 0.9.x line (currently
    0.9.7)</p></li>
<li><p>The latest Win32 Apache HTTPd release.  From this tarball, we
    will use the APR, APR-util and APR-iconv bundled libraries.  Note
    that we should be using the win32 APR tarballs, but they currently
    have EOL issues on the win32 tarballs.  Check whether this has
    been fixed, and start using those if it has. (and edit this
    document to reflect this)</p></li>
<li><p>A supported version of Neon (currently 0.25.5 is
    preferred).</p></li>
<li><p>zlib</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have all this, you can start the following procedure.
When it is done, you will have a build environment ready to roll
tarballs.</p>

<p>TODO: finish</p>

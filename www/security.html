<p>If you discover a security vulnerability in Subversion, please
email:</p>

<!-- See http://www.cdt.org/speech/spam/030319spamreport.shtml for
     evidence that this has some effect. -->
<ul>
<p><strong>&#115;<span>&#101;&#099;&#117;</span>&#114;&#105;&#116;<span>&#121;&#064;&#115;&#117;&#098;&#118;&#101;</span>&#114;&#115;&#105;&#111;<span>&#110;</span>&#046;&#116;&#105;&#103;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</strong></p>
</ul>

<p>It is safe to send sensitive reports to this address.  List
membership is controlled, and its archives are not publicly
accessible.  We will analyze your report and take appropriate action.
Our usual procedure is to</p>

<ol>
   <li>Make a fix for the vulnerability.</li>

   <li>Discreetly distribute the fix to a few large sites that run
   Subversion servers and are trusted to be discreet themselves.</li>

   <li>Release a new version of Subversion (containing just that fix)
   and publicly announce the vulnerability on the same day.</li>
</ol>

<p>This procedure may vary depending on the nature of the
vulnerability and the degree of pre-existing public awareness, of
course.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">Subversion 1.4.0 has NOT yet been

that will mean 1.4.0 is released.</p>

<h2>What's New in Subversion 1.4</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>svnsync</strong>, a new repository mirroring tool</li>
  <li>Huge working-copy performance improvements</li>
  <li>Support for BerkeleyDB 4.4 and its "auto recovery" feature</li>
  <li>Size improvements to the binary delta algorithm</li>
  <li>A handful of new command switches</li>
  <li>Many improved APIs</li>
  <li>More than 40 new bugfixes</li>
</ul>

<p>Details are described below.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.4 is a superset of all previous Subversion releases,
and is considered the current "best" release.  Anything in 1.0.x,
1.1.x, 1.2.x or 1.3.x is also in 1.4, but 1.4 contains features and
bugfixes not present in any earlier release.  The new features will
eventually be documented in a 1.4 version of the free Subversion book,
see <a
href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">svnbook.red-bean.com</a>.</p>

<div class="h2" id="compatibility" title="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.4
servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.4 features may not
be available unless both client and server are the latest version.
There is <strong>no need</strong> to dump and reload your
repositories; Subversion 1.4 can read repositories created by earlier
versions.  To upgrade an existing installation, just install the
newest libraries and binaries on top of the older ones.</p>

<p>Subversion 1.4 maintains API/ABI compatibility with earlier
releases, by only adding new functions.  A program written to the 1.0,
1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 API can both compile and run using 1.4 libraries.
However, a program written for 1.4 cannot necessarily compile or run
against older libraries.</p>

<div class="h3" id="wc-format-change" title="wc-format-change">
<h3>Working Copy and Repository Format Changes</h3>

<p>Due to certain improvements and bugfixes made to the working copy
library, the version number of the working copy format has been
incremented. This means that Subversion clients earlier than 1.4 will
<i>not</i> be able to work with working copies produced by Subversion
1.4.  Similarly, the repository format has changed as well, meaning
that pre-1.4 Subversion tools that normally access a repository
directly
(e.g. <tt>svnserve</tt>, <tt>mod_dav_svn</tt>, <tt>svnadmin</tt>)
won't be able to read a repository originally created by Subversion
1.4. </p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> if a Subversion 1.4 client encounters a pre-1.4
working copy, it will <i>automatically</i> upgrade the working copy
format as soon as it touches it, making it unreadable by older
Subversion clients.  If you are using several versions of Subversion
on your machine, you need to be careful about which version you use in
which working copy, to avoid accidentally upgrading the working copy
format.  This "auto upgrade" feature, however, does <em>not</em> occur
with the new repository format.  </p>

</div>  <!-- wc-format-change -->

<div class="h3" id="output-changes" title="output-changes">
<h3>Command Line Output Changes</h3>

<p>Although the Subversion developers try hard to keep output from the
command line programs compatible between releases, new information
sometimes has to be added.  This might break scripts that rely on the
exact format of the output.  In 1.4, the following changes have been
made to the output:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>TODO</p></li>

</ul>

<div class="h2" id="new-features" title="new-features">
<h2>New Features</h2>

<div class="h3" id="svnsync" title="svnsync">
<h3>svnsync (<em>some features require a 1.4 server</em>)</h3>

<p>A new tool &mdash; <strong>svnsync</strong> &mdash; is now
installed as part of the standard distribution.  This tool provides
the ability to replicate history from one repository to another.  The
replication can happen all at once, or can be done incrementally
through repeated 'sync' operations.  Because the tool uses the
abstract network (RA) API, the source and destination repositories can
be either local, remote, or any combination thereof.</p>

<p><em>Compatibility note</em>: in order to "push" information into a
destination repository, any version of the server will suffice.  The
pushing is done through ordinary network commits.  To "pull" history
from the source repository, however, requires a 1.4 (or later)
server.</p>

<p>Usage of this tool will be documented in the Subversion book soon,
but for now, running <tt>svnsync help</tt> should suffice; the number
of subcommands is very small, and the help system documents them
all.</p>

</div> <!-- svnsync -->

<div class="h3" id="wc-improvements" title="wc-improvements">
<h3>Working copy performance improvements (<em>client</em>)</h3>

<p>The way in which the Subversion client manages your working copy
has undergone radical changes.  The <tt>.svn/entries</tt> file is no
longer XML, and the client has become smarter about the way it manages
and stores property metadata.</p>

<p>As a result, there are substantial performance improvements.  The
new working copy format allows the client to more quickly search a
working copy, detect file modifications, manage property metadata, and
deal with large files.  The overall disk footprint is smaller as well,
with fewer inodes being used.  Additionally, a number of long standing
bugs related to merging and copying have been fixed.</p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> A Subversion 1.4 client will silently upgrade older
working copies to the new format, rendering them unreadable by older
Subersion clients.  See the section above, titled 'Working Copy Format
Changes'.</p>

</div> <!-- wc-improvements -->

<div class="h3" id="bdb-4.4" title="bdb-4.4">
<h3>BerkeleyDB 4.4 and auto-recovery (<em>server</em>)</h3>

<p>A common problem with previous versions of Subversion is that
crashed server processes could leave BerkeleyDB-based repositories in
an unusable "wedged" state, requiring administrators to manually
intervene and bring back online.  (Note: this is not due to bugs in
BerkeleyDB, but due to the unorthodox way in which Subversion uses
it!)</p>

<p>Subversion 1.4 can now be compiled against BerkeleyDB 4.4, which
has a new "auto-recovery" feature.  If a Subversion server process
crashes and leaves the repository in an inconsistent state, the next
process which attempts to access the repository will notice the
problem, grab exclusive control of the repository, and automatically
recover it.  In theory (and in our testing), this new feature makes
BerkeleyDB-based repositories just as wedge-proof as FSFS
repositories.</p>

</div>  <!-- bdb-4.4 -->

<div class="h3" id="svndiff1" title="svndiff1">
<h3>Binary Delta Encoding Improvements (<em>client and server</em>)</h3>

<p>Subversion uses the xdelta algorithm to compute differences between
strings of bytes.  The output of this algorithm is stored in a custom
format called 'svndiff'.  svndiff data is what's stored in the
repository to represent the difference between successive versions of
files, and svndiff data is also transmitted over the wire between
client and server (e.g. during updates and commits.)</p>

<p>In Subversion 1.4, the svndiff format has been improved to use much
less disk space &mdash; up to 50% less on plain text files in some
cases.  Thus, if you choose to dump and reload your repository, the
new repository should be noticeably smaller on disk.  (Make sure
to <tt>svnadmin create</tt> the new repository using svnadmin 1.4.)
Additionally, if a client and server are both version 1.4 , then
network traffic becomes smaller and faster.</p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> A repository created by svnadmin 1.4 will not be
readable by earlier Subversion libraries or tools.  However, in order
to experience the smaller data format, you'll have to dump and reload
your data.  If you <em>don't</em> recreate your repository with
svnadmin 1.4, it will continue writing data in the older, larger
format, and will still be readable by older Subversion tools.</p>

<p>The Subversion 1.2.x line is no longer supported.  This doesn't
mean that your 1.2 installation is doomed; if it works well and is all
you need, that's fine.  "No longer supported" just means we've stopped
accepting bug reports against 1.2.x versions, and will not make any
more 1.2.x bugfix releases, except perhaps for absolutely critical
security or data-loss bugs.</p>

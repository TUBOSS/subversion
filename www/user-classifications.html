<h2>User Classifications</h2>

<p>In use case lingo, the typical <em>actors</em> for our version
control scenarios.  The following list provides rough classifications
for the type of individual users driving our requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Novice</em>: A developer inexperienced with version
  control, your typical documentation writer, or non-technical
  user (e.g. pointy-haired manager, administrative assistent,
  etc.).  Able to make commits, but often lacking enough understanding
  of version control concepts to check out or switch to a branch.
  Sometimes does creative things like "delete large chunks of the
  repository" or "commit a merge conflict".</li>

  <li><em>Developer</em>: A software professional familiar with most
  of the basic concepts used with a typical version control system
  (e.g. repositories, workspaces, etc.), including change management
  (e.g. commit, revert, merge, patch, conflict resolution, etc.).</li>

  <li><em>Merge Meister</em>: A version control master, usually
  involved in all important branching/merging activities, and often
  responsible for release engineering.  Usually involved in auditing
  the changes in a branch, and process enforcement.  Often proficient
  with multiple version control systems.</li>

  <li><em>Other Programs</em>: Other programs which invoke
  Subversion's functionality.  These are often scripts wrapped around
  the command-line binaries (e.g. for SCM automation, integration,
  etc.), which are sometimes APIs in their own right.  They're also
  often third party programs built on top of Subversion, integrated
  with its core libraries at the API level.</li>

</ul>
